Plugin for reenactment of famous paintings.

== Description ==

An image says more than a thousand words, but what about two images? We bet they say more than ten thousand words!

There are popular and funny websites nowadays supporting reenactments of famous cultural images [Get Inside Paintings](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/10834099/Tired-of-looking-at-paintings-Now-you-can-get-inside-them.html) or identification of doubles for famous persons 
[Celebrities Look Alike](http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/gallery/201207178683/celebrities-that-look-alike/6/)
You can use this Image Twinning plugin to integrate similar functionality in your applications!
