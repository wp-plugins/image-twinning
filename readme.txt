Plugin for reenactment of famous paintings.

== Description ==

An image says more than a thousand words, but what about two images? We bet they say more than ten thousand words!

Examples are recreated and reenacted images with popular or famous originals, but also the comparison of doubles.

Feel free to download this plugin and deploy it in your own environment. We are very interested in hearing from you, especially if you work on new ideas or scenarios for the usage of our plugin!
